  <h1>World War II: French Invasion</h1>
  <h3>Battle of France</h3>
  <main>[May 10-June 25]The Germans have just launched an invasion around the Maginot Line just like they did in World War I, seeming like a repeat of the First World War. adolf Hitler had a different plan though that not many saw coming. The French thought the Ardennes Forest was naturally impenetrable and left very little to no divisions in the forest. So when Adolf ordered German Armoured Units throuhg the Ardennes and along the Somme valley, the allies were caught off guard and got all of their best divisions encircled. Now the question is not if France is going to surrender, but when is France going to surrender.</main>
  <ol>
    <li>What did the allies do to protect France?
      <ul>
        <li>Sned troops through Belgium to to stop the Germans in Belgium. 
        <li>Heavily Guarded the Maginot Line to hope the Germans to wear out against the Benelux. 
        <li>Had Naval blockades around Northern Europe against German imports hoping to drain them to surrender(Just like WWI)
      </ul>
    <li>Why did France leave the Ardennes unprotected?
      <ul>
        <li>They knew about the German Armoured Divisions and never thought they would try to go through the thick forest. 
        <li>They Needed all the help they could get when going to fight Germany in Belgium to keep the fight as far away from home as possible.
      </ul>
  </ol>
