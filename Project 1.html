    <h1>World War II Pearl Harbor</h1>
    <p><b>Pearl Harbor</b>, being a devastating time for the Americans in the 1940's, bring spon the worlds largest scale War to the Americans. Japans attack on Pearl Harbor was a suprising attack, in which no one saw coming. It would damage the harbor  and destroy a few ships. America is lucky that it wasn't worse.</p>
    <h3>December 7, 1941</h3>
    <p>Starting off as a normal morning around 7:00 a.m. for people in Hawaii, nothing made it seem different to any other day. it wasnt until around 7:45 that things started to act a little strane. <i>Pearl Harbor</i> is a base for the US Navy to restock potrolling the Pacific Ocean. So when they started to notice some dots heading their way fast on a radar, they did something was off, but they also thought it was one of theirs. So they did three check ups to see if they were the only ones finding it:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Check up with other radars around the Harbor</li>
      <li>Check to see if there were any ships nearby to confirm</li>
      <li>Tried to contact the planes</li>
    </ol>
    <p>They got no response back when trying to contact the planes to see what they were doing, but when they got nothing, one young soldiier on duty went to his general who brushed it off. The young man still felt uneased by the whole situation and felt like something had to be done. By that time, it 7:55 a.m. and the planes of several Imperial Japanese Navy, later to to be approximitly 353 aircrafts, stormed the Harbor. The goal for the Japanese was to take away the US in the Pacific War and have free roam of any island in Asia, Indoneasia, and Oceanic.</p>
    <p>In a major turn of events for the US, it was unfortunate for them to hear  the casualty rate hitting around 2,403. In Japanese eyes, it was a succes, and an utter disaster for the Americans. In reality, it would be a plan failed for the Japanese and lucky brake for the US. The Japanese were ordered to destroy everything they could see. They were only able to destory/damage:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Destroyed 2 battledships, only damaging 6 others</li>
      <li>Destroyed 1 other US personel, damaging 10 others</li>
      <li>Very little damage to the Harbor itself</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Recovery</h3>
    <p>Suprsing the Japanese with a quick recovery is exactlyu what the US did. Just six months after they attack on Pearl Harbor, US fleet would attack Japanese ships and won the battle. It almost seemed as if nothing had happened just six months ago. It was a huge victory and the realization of a major defeat back at Pearl Harbor for the Japanese.</p>
    <p>Fortunatly, the attack on the Harbor would begin the fall of the Axis and start the turning point in the Second World War. Although, the war would still march on for another 4 years, The United states join on the Allies side is a huge turning point in the war. </p>
    </ul>
